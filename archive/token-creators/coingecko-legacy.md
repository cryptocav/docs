To register an asset with CoinGecko it is typically a requirement that the asset is first listed for trading in a market tracked by CoinGecko, such as Orca.
Once liquidity for your asset exists on Orca (see [How to create an initial pool for an asset](/token-creators/clmm-pools)) it should be easier to register your asset with CoinGecko.
CoinGecko provides detailed documents for the process of adding a token to Coingecko, which can be found here ([How to list new cryptocurrencies on CoinGecko](https://support.coingecko.com/hc/en-us/articles/7291312302617-How-to-list-new-cryptocurrencies-on-CoinGecko-)).
