CLMMs enable liquidity providers (LPs) to concentrate their capital in targeted price bands rather than across the entire price spectrum. This approach results in more densely packed liquidity within the selected ranges, typically around the current market price. This enhances capital efficiency and reduces both price impact and slippage.

Each position's price range operates like its own CPMM price curve. But unlike CPMMs, which require both assets in a pair, a CLMM position can consist entirely of just one token. This flexibility allows LPs to optimize their strategies based on market conditions, providing greater control and potential returns.
