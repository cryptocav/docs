Whether you are a beginner or an advanced LP, once you have created your position, it is important to know how to manage it within the UI.
All positions created through the UI are represented by an NFT that is held in your wallet. These NFTs can be transferred freely between wallets; they can be moved to other wallets or stored in a hardware wallet.
Be aware, only the wallet holding the NFT can interact with the position in the UI. If you transfer the NFT to an incorrect address, or burn it by accident, you will lose access to all of the liquidity associated with the NFT, and the funds will be irrevocably lost.
The easiest way to perform many portfolio tasks in Orca v2 is by using the Portfolio Management Sidebar.
