Orca's concentrated liquidity (CLMM) pools offer liquidity providers (LPs) advanced features that surpass traditional constant product market makers (CPMMs). With Orca v2, LPs enjoy enhanced capital efficiency and the ability to concentrate assets within specific price ranges.

Concentrated liquidity pools can replace traditional Central Limit Order Books (CLOBs), allowing anyone to create pools with Orca's fully permissionless pool creation tools.
However, thorough research is essential before engaging in active liquidity provision to understand the mechanics, risks, and strategies involved.

### What is a CLMM?

CLMM stands for Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market Maker. CLMMs enable liquidity providers (LPs) to allocate their capital to specific price ranges, rather than distributing it uniformly across all prices. This targeted approach allows LPs to maximize capital efficiency and potential yields, while also providing an enhanced experience for traders.

#### Benefits of a Concentrated Liquidity AMM (CLMM) vs. a Constant Product AMM (CPMM)

* **Enhanced Capital Efficiency**: LPs can focus their capital on the most profitable price ranges instead of spreading it across the entire price curve. This results in a more efficient use of capital.
* **Increased Earning Potential**: By concentrating funds in areas with high trading volume, LPs can earn more from transaction fees. The fees accrued per unit of capital deployed can significantly exceed those in traditional full-range CPMM pools.
* **Flexible Management**: CLMMs offer LPs the flexibility to adjust their price ranges in response to current or anticipated market conditions, optimizing returns and managing risk more effectively than in a CPMM.
* **Advanced Techniques**: CLMMs support advanced strategies that can mimic other protocols, such as limit orders and take-profit orders, providing greater versatility for LPs.

Overall, CLMMs enhance the efficiency and profitability of liquidity provision while offering traders a better trading experience.
