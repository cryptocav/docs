Due to [divergence loss](/liquidity/concepts/impermanent-loss), you are not guaranteed a positive return when providing liquidity.

#### Open the Position Details sidebar

→ See the [Position Details Sidebar Guide](/liquidity/manage/sidebar) for a full walkthrough.

#### Enter deposit amounts

With the `Deposit` tab selected, enter the amount you wish to deposit in one of the highlighted fields.

The other values will adjust automatically to match the deposit ratio required for your existing range.

Alternatively, you can click `Max` in a deposit field to contribute the maximum quantity of tokens from your wallet.

If you want to use *Autoswap*, which matches the position's deposit ratio by trading one token for the other within the pair, please:
→ See the Autoswap guide for more details.

#### (Optional) Adjust your liquidity slippage

If required you can adjust your liquidity slippage by clicking on the `Liq. slippage` button.
→ See [**Understanding Slippage**](/trade/slippage) for more information.

#### Complete your deposit

Once you are satisfied with your deposit amounts, click `Deposit`.

#### Review your transaction

Review the details in your wallet—including any network fees—and approve the transaction.

**REVIEW CAREFULLY.** It is critical that you check your range and ensure the current price of the pool matches your intentions. Depositing liquidity at a price not consistent with wider market values may result in irreversible loss.

#### Deposit Complete!🎉

You will not receive a new pool position NFT. Your existing NFT will continue to represent the updated position.
The NFT remains in your wallet and is displayed as a simple image with the warning "**DO NOT BURN**."


**DO NOT** sell or burn this NFT. You can send it to another wallet to transfer your position, but (whale forbid) please **DO NOT** burn or sell it, or you'll lose your liquidity!
Orca **CANNOT** help you recover any funds lost as a result of burning a pool position NFT. Please **DO NOT** burn or sell it, or you'll lose your liquidity!
