Whether you're new to liquidity provision or an experienced LP, it’s important to understand how to manage your position within the UI once it has been created.

All positions created through the Orca UI are represented by NFTs held in your wallet. These NFTs can be freely transferred to other wallets, including hardware wallets for safekeeping.

However, only the wallet that holds the NFT can interact with the associated position in the UI. If the NFT is sent to an incorrect address or accidentally burned, access to the position—and the liquidity it contains—will be permanently lost.

To manage your positions efficiently, use the *Position Details* Sidebar, which provides quick access to a range of portfolio actions in Orca v2.
→ See the [Position Management Sidebar Guide](/liquidity/position-sidebar) for a detailed walkthrough.
