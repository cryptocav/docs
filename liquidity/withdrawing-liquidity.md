The other values will adjust automatically to match the withdrawal ratio for your current price range.

Alternatively, you can click `Max` in a field to withdraw the maximum quantity of tokens.

If you enter values that result in removing all liquidity, or select `Max` in a token field, the `Withdraw` button will change to `Close Position`.

#### (Optional) Retain Your Pool Position NFT

If you are removing all your liquidity, you can choose to retain the NFT by unchecking the `Harvest and burn the NFT of this position` checkbox.

Retaining your NFT allows you to redeposit into the same empty range later, maintaining the original parameters.
