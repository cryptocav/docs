Orca empowers token creators (and others) to permissionlessly create tokens and pools for their tokens.

In the following section, you will find a range of helpful how-to guides for using the permissionless token creation and listing tools, as well as other steps for improving your token holders’ experience.

Some Token Creators may be interested in learning about Orca's support and integration in regards to Token Extensions. You may check out our document on [Token Extension support here](/create/pools/extensions).

If you are unsure about any part of this process, please reach out to Orca for support. If you do not have an existing channel of communication with Orca, please open a ticket by using the `Support` function in the wallet menu, or on [Orca's Discord](https://discord.gg/orca-so), or [Orca's Telegram](https://t.me/orca_so).
