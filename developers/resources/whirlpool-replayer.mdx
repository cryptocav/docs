# Whirlpool Replayer

Extracting Whirlpool related transactions, from Solana's vast transaction history, and recovering historical states from that data has been an insurmountable problem.

However, developers using Whirlpool can use the whirlpool-replayer library to get the state of a Whirlpool on a given day and all the instructions that were executed in sequence through callbacks. Within the callback, developers can focus on extracting the data they need.

Don't worry. There is absolutely no need to have a special machine; whirlpool-replayer replays only the Whirlpool Program. Therefore, it requires very few machine resources and will run reliably on a laptop computer.

Many use cases for whirlpool-replayer come to mind.

* Extracting OHLCV history
* Extracting liquidity distribution history
* Calculating profit over the life cycle of a position
* Back-testing of trade strategies
