Wavebreak is Orca's token launchpad designed to give humans fair access to new token launches on Solana.
> TL;DR Wavebreak is Orca’s new human-first launchpad on Solana. It distributes new tokens through a transparent bonding-curve sale, letting the price rise smoothly as demand increases, then graduates successfully launched tokens straight into Orca Whirlpools for deep, permissionless liquidity. Traders earn points for their trade volume during bonding, which convert into Daily Rewards.

### Why Wavebreak?

| Problem | How Wavebreak helps |
|---------|--------------------|
| Sniping bots always win | Orca's proprietary Anti-bot System gives everyone equal access to trade the token in the bonding phase, nullifying the advantage of sniping. |
| Fragmented liquidity after launch | At Graduation, 200 million tokens and 84 SOL raised during bonding are auto-seeded into a Whirlpool, making the token instantly tradable on Orca and aggregator platforms. |
| Complicated launch processes | Anyone can permissionlessly launch a token in a few easy steps. |
| Token creators sniping | The initial locked liquidity position belongs to the token creator, and earns LP fees—providing an incentive to stay aligned with holders. |
| Lack of incentive to trade early | Users earn Points for trading any token while it’s still bonding. The more Points earned, the larger the share of Rewards. |

### How it works

### Launch a token

Anyone can permissionlessly launch a token in just a few simple steps.

### Bonding phase

* Users buy tokens with SOL.
* Wavebreak mints tokens incrementally along the bonding curve, increasing the spot price with each unit purchased.Users buy tokens with SOL. Wavebreak mints tokens incrementally along the Bonding Curve, increasing the spot price with each unit purchased.

* Tokens sold during bonding are burned in exchange for SOL, but added back to the amount available to buy. The total supply will still reach 1,000,000,000 tokens at Graduation.
* Price increases deterministically with each trade. Buyers can preview estimated tokens received (subject to slippage) before confirming.

* Orca’s proprietary Anti-bot System protects humans from losing out to sniping bots.
* Users earn points for every trade during bonding, proportional to their trade size.

### Graduation

* Bonding ends when 85 SOL worth of the token exists in circulation.
* 1.18% of the SOL collected during bonding is taken as a protocol fee (~1 SOL).

* Wavebreak uses 19.32% of supply together with 84 SOL to create a full range locked liquidity position in a new Whirlpool.
* The token creator owns this locked LP position and earns 87% of trading fees generated from it.

* At Graduation, a portion of the token supply is set aside for Daily Rewards and allocated to users in proportion to their Points.

### Post-launch trading

* The token is **instantly liquid** on Orca and any aggregator that supports Whirlpools.

### Rewards Program

### Daily Rewards

* Throughout the rewards period, a portion of the token supply is distributed to Daily Rewards.
* At the end of the rewards period, these tokens distributed to Daily Rewards are shared among users proportionally based on their respective pro rata share of the total balance of Points issued for that token during the rewards period.

### Earn Points by buying and selling

* Points are earned based on the volume users trade in tokens that are still bonding.
* When trading, the Wavebreak Trading Modal will display how many Points a user’s trade will earn.

* Users’ current Points balance can be found in the Rewards Panel, alongside the estimated value of their total Rewards Points and their number of reward tokens.

### Daily token drops

* Daily Rewards are allocated to users at 8:00 pm Eastern Time each day.
* All users who earned Points during the period receive a share of each token that graduated—regardless of which tokens they traded—based on their pro rata share of the total Points earned for that token.

* After allocation, Point balances reset and the next 24-hour cycle begins.

### Claim what you want, when you want

* Users can view and claim rewards anytime via the Rewards Panel.
* Rewards never expire.

* Up to 6 tokens can be claimed per transaction.

### Key Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| Bonding Curve | A mathematical formula that sets token price based on how many tokens are in circulation. As more tokens are bought, the price increases. |
| Anti-bot Protection | Orca’s proprietary anti-bot system ensures humans have fair access from the start. |
| Graduation | When the sale ends, a Whirlpool is auto-created using 19.8% of the token supply and 84 SOL. This Whirlpool is a special 1% fee-tier Adaptive Fee Pool, making the token instantly tradable on Orca and integrated aggregator platforms. |
| Points | Earned for trading during the bonding phase. Points determine users’ pro rata share of the Daily Rewards. |
| Daily Rewards | A proportion of each day's graduated tokens is pooled and allocated to point-holders at 8:00 pm Eastern Time. Rewards are claimable anytime. |
| Whirlpools | Orca’s concentrated liquidity (CLMM) pools enable efficient trading and liquidity providers to earn fees within defined price ranges. |
