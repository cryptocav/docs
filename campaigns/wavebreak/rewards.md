#### How do I earn Points?

You earn Points by buying and selling tokens on Wavebreak that have not yet graduated, this includes when making an initial buy made when launching your token. Points are valid for a single reward period of 24 hours—after that, your balance resets to 0.

#### What do Points do?

Points give you a share of a portion of all the tokens that graduate during the 24-hour period in which you earned them.

Even if you didn’t trade a specific token, you still receive a share if it graduated in a period in which you earned Points. You can claim your Rewards at any time in the *Claim Rewards* section. The number of tokens you are entitled to claim is based on your respective pro rata share of the total balance of Points issued during the rewards period.

#### What is Bonding and Graduation?

Every Wavebreak token starts in the Bonding stage. This ends once 85 SOL worth of the token exists. At that Point, the token graduates. Graduation means the token becomes tradeable outside Wavebreak.

You earn Points when buying and selling tokens on Wavebreak during the Bonding stage.

#### Where and how do I claim my Rewards?

Click the `Rewards` button in the main navigation. There, you’ll see:

* Your current Points
* A countdown to the next reset

* Your available Rewards

You can claim your Rewards here anytime. You’ll be able to choose a maximum of 6 different tokens to claim in a single transaction. Rewards that have been allocated to you will never expire and can be claimed at any time in the future.

#### Why are there tokens I haven’t traded in my Rewards?

You receive tokens that graduated during any period where you earned Points, even if you didn’t trade that token yourself.

So even if you missed a trending token, you’ll still have it included in your Rewards.

#### How long can I claim Rewards from my Points?

Your Points reset every 24 hours, but your Rewards do not expire. You can claim them whenever you like

#### Do I have to do anything to convert my Points into Rewards?

No, your Points are automatically converted into your share of the Rewards at the end of the period, no action is required.

#### Are there costs to claiming Rewards?

You will pay normal network fees to harvest tokens, this includes rent fees for the creation of any necessary associated token accounts (ATAs), as with any other token on Solana, rent fees can be recouped in the future by closing an empty ATA.
