#### Create a Solana wallet

To use Orca, you need a supported Solana compatible wallet, you can find a list of compatible wallets [here](/reference/useful-information/wallets). Orca is a decentralized protocol that facilitates trades on Solana, as Orca is non-custodial when you trade tokens the protocol will interact directly with your wallet.

#### Get some SOL

Orca is built on the Solana blockchain, so you need SOL in your wallet to pay network fees. Transactions may fail if you do not maintain a minimum balance of 0.05 SOL.
   To obtain some SOL either:

   * Purchase SOL on a centralized exchange of your choice, or...
   * Purchase SOL through a fiat on-ramp service, these are integrated into some wallets.
* **(optional) Move SOL to your wallet** If you went for the centralized exchange option you need to move the SOL to your wallet. The exact methods vary wallet to wallet but typically involve the following.

   * Click `Deposit` or `Receive`.
   * Select/find SOL.
   * Copy/scan the deposit address.
   * Use this address to withdraw your SOL from the centralized exchange.

   **Important:** confirm that the deposit address is correct and the selected withdrawal method is **Solana SPL.** It is sensible to test with a small amount first.
