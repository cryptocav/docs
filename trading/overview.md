It just works.

Buying crypto shouldn’t have to be hard. This core belief is what drove the creation of Orca in the first place. And over time, this philosophy has given birth to entirely new ways to buy and sell crypto on Orca.
Orca is the smoothest, fastest and most reliable incarnation of Orca. An innovative UI for traders to tap into Orca: the apex liquidity layer on Solana. Orca continues to deliver an easy-to-integrate, capital-efficient, permissionless trading environment. Feel the difference and dive into a human-centered UI that is built to just work.

Orca v2 gives traders an opportunity to compare their quote to one from the Jupiter aggregator and to chose between Orca and Jupiter’s quote without ever leaving Orca.
