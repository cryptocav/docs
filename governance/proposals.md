This guide explains how to create, submit, and advance governance proposals for Orca. Whether you have an idea to improve the protocol or want to address an issue, this is your pathway to making it happen.

## Proposal Process Overview

Every proposal follows this journey:

```
Idea → Discussion → Draft → Review → Vote → Implementation
```

| Phase | Where | Duration |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **1. Idea** | Discord #governance | Ongoing |
| **2. Discussion** | Governance Forum | 1-2 weeks |
| **3. Draft** | Forum post | 3-7 days |
| **4. Review** | Community feedback | 5-7 days |
| **5. Vote** | Realms | 3-7 days |
| **6. Implementation** | DAO Council/Team | Varies |

## Before You Propose

### Do Your Research

Before submitting a proposal:

1. **Search existing proposals** - Your idea may already be discussed
2. **Understand the protocol** - Know how Orca works and its current state
3. **Consider implications** - Think about technical, economic, and community impact
4. **Gather feedback** - Test your idea informally in Discord first

### Types of Proposals

| Type | Examples | Typical Complexity |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Protocol Changes** | New pool types, fee adjustments | High |
| **Treasury Allocation** | Grants, partnerships, marketing | Medium |
| **Governance Updates** | Voting rules, Council changes | Medium |
| **Community Initiatives** | Events, educational content | Low |

## Proposal Template

Use this structure for your proposal:

### Required Sections

```markdown
# [Title of Your Proposal]

## Summary
A 50-250 word overview of what you're proposing and why.
This should be understandable without reading further.

## Motivation
- What problem does this solve?
- Why should Orca implement this?
- What happens if we don't do this?

## Description
Detailed explanation of the proposal:
- What changes would be made?
- How would it work technically?
- What resources are needed?

## Implementation
- Who would implement this?
- What's the timeline?
- What are the milestones?

## Risks and Considerations
- What could go wrong?
- How do we mitigate risks?
- What are the trade-offs?
```

### Optional Sections

```markdown
## Cost Analysis
- Financial costs
- Development resources
- Ongoing maintenance

## Success Metrics
- How do we measure success?
- What KPIs apply?

## Appendices
- Technical specifications
- Supporting data
- External references
```

## Writing Your Proposal

### Summary Section Tips

Your summary should:
- State the proposal clearly in the first sentence
- Explain the key benefit in 2-3 sentences
- Mention implementation complexity
- Be understandable by non-technical readers

**Good example:**
> "This proposal introduces a 0.01% fee tier for stablecoin pairs to capture more trading volume from aggregators. Lower fees would make Orca more competitive for stablecoin swaps, potentially increasing volume by 30-50%. Implementation requires a single governance transaction."

### Motivation Section Tips

Answer these questions:
1. **What problem exists?** - Describe the current situation
2. **Why does it matter?** - Explain the impact
3. **Why now?** - Address timing if relevant

### Description Section Tips

Be specific:
- Avoid vague language ("improve things")
- Include concrete parameters
- Reference existing documentation where relevant
- Use diagrams or tables for complex concepts

### Implementation Section Tips

Address:
- **Who** will do the work
- **How** it will be executed (technical steps)
- **When** milestones will be reached
- **What** success looks like
