Orca is governed by its community through a decentralized governance system. Token holders can propose changes, vote on decisions, and shape the future of the protocol.

## How Governance Works

Orca's governance operates through a combination of community voting and an elected DAO Council:

1. **Community Proposals** - Any ORCA token holder can submit proposals for protocol changes
2. **Discussion Period** - Proposals are discussed openly before voting begins
3. **Voting** - Token holders vote using their ORCA (or xORCA) tokens
4. **Execution** - Approved proposals are implemented by the team or DAO Council

## Why Participate?

Your voice matters in shaping Orca's future:

- **Influence protocol direction** - Vote on new features, fee structures, and partnerships
- **Protect your interests** - Have a say in decisions that affect your liquidity positions
- **Earn governance rewards** - Stakers earn additional ORCA through the xORCA system
- **Join a community** - Connect with other Orca users who care about DeFi's future

## Getting Started

### 1. Hold ORCA Tokens

You need ORCA tokens to participate in governance. You can:
- [Swap for ORCA](https://www.orca.so) on the Orca platform
- Purchase on supported exchanges

### 2. Stake for xORCA (Optional but Recommended)

Staking your ORCA for xORCA gives you:
- **Boosted voting power** - xORCA carries more weight than unstaked ORCA
- **Staking rewards** - Earn additional ORCA over time
- **Protocol alignment** - Demonstrate long-term commitment to Orca

### 3. Stay Informed

Follow governance discussions:
- [Orca Discord](https://discord.gg/orca-so) - #governance channel
- [Governance Forum](https://gov.orca.so) - Proposal discussions
- [Realms](https://realms.today/dao/ORCA) - On-chain voting platform

### 4. Vote on Proposals

When you're ready:
1. Review active proposals on [Realms](https://realms.today/dao/ORCA)
2. Read the discussion and understand the implications
3. Cast your vote before the deadline
4. Your vote is weighted by your token holdings

## Governance Structure

### Community Members

All ORCA/xORCA holders can:
- Submit proposals (with minimum token threshold)
- Vote on all proposals
- Participate in discussions
- Delegate voting power to others

### DAO Council

The elected [DAO Council](/governance/council) has authority to:
- Execute routine operational decisions
- Implement approved proposals
- Act quickly when needed (with community oversight)
- Manage protocol parameters within defined bounds

The Council operates transparently and can be replaced by community vote.

## Types of Proposals

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Protocol Upgrades** | Changes to smart contracts or core functionality | New pool types, fee mechanisms |
| **Parameter Changes** | Adjustments to existing settings | Fee tier changes, reward rates |
| **Treasury Allocation** | How protocol funds are spent | Grants, partnerships, development |
| **Governance Changes** | Modifications to governance itself | Voting thresholds, Council composition |
