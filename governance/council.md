The Orca DAO Council is an elected body that helps execute governance decisions and manage day-to-day protocol operations. The Council acts on behalf of the community while remaining accountable to token holders.

## What is the DAO Council?

The DAO Council was established through Orca's governance process to:

- **Speed up execution** - Handle routine decisions without requiring full community votes
- **Provide expertise** - Bring specialized knowledge to complex protocol decisions
- **Maintain accountability** - Act transparently with community oversight
- **Bridge governance gaps** - Ensure the protocol can respond quickly when needed

Think of the Council as elected representatives who handle operational matters while major strategic decisions still go to community vote.
