Orca governance gives you a voice in the protocol's future. Whether you hold 10 ORCA or 10,000, your participation matters. This guide shows you how to get involved.

## Why Participate?

### Your Vote Matters

- **Shape the protocol** - Decisions affect features, fees, and direction
- **Protect your interests** - Have a say in changes that impact your positions
- **Small votes count** - Close votes are decided by margins—yours could be decisive
- **Build reputation** - Active participants gain influence in the community

### It's Easier Than You Think

You don't need to be a DeFi expert. Start by:
1. Following discussions
2. Voting on proposals you understand
3. Gradually engaging more deeply

## Ways to Participate

### 1. Vote on Proposals

**Effort level:** Low
**Impact:** High

The simplest way to participate—review active proposals and cast your vote.

#### How to Vote

1. Go to [Realms](https://realms.today/dao/ORCA)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Browse active proposals
4. Read the proposal and discussion
5. Click **Vote** and select your choice
6. Approve the transaction

#### Voting Tips

- **Read the full proposal** - Not just the title
- **Check the discussion** - See what others are saying
- **Understand the impact** - How does this affect you?
- **Vote your conviction** - Your opinion is valid

### 2. Join Discussions

**Effort level:** Low to Medium
**Impact:** Medium

Governance decisions are shaped by discussion before voting.

#### Where to Discuss

| Platform | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| **Discord #governance** | Quick questions, informal discussion |
| **Governance Forum** | Detailed proposals, formal debate |
| **Twitter/X** | Broader community awareness |

#### Discussion Guidelines

**Do:**
- Ask clarifying questions
- Share your perspective respectfully
- Point out potential issues or benefits
- Support good ideas with reactions/upvotes

**Don't:**
- Spam or repeat the same point
- Attack others personally
- Dismiss ideas without explanation
- Derail discussions off-topic

### 3. Comment on Proposals

**Effort level:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium to High

Thoughtful comments can shape how proposals evolve.

#### Effective Comments

When commenting on a proposal:

1. **Summarize your position** - Support, oppose, or undecided
2. **Explain your reasoning** - Why do you feel this way?
3. **Suggest improvements** - How could it be better?
4. **Ask questions** - What's unclear?

**Example good comment:**
> "I support this proposal because it addresses the fee competitiveness issue. However, I'd suggest a 60-day review period instead of 30 to gather more data. Question: How will this affect existing LPs?"

### 4. Submit Proposals

**Effort level:** High
**Impact:** Very High

Have an idea to improve Orca? Propose it.

#### Before Proposing

1. **Research thoroughly** - Understand the current state
2. **Test your idea** - Discuss informally first
3. **Build support** - Gauge community interest
4. **Write clearly** - Make your case compelling

#### Proposal Process

1. Start a discussion post on the forum
2. Gather feedback and refine
3. Submit formal proposal
4. Campaign for support
5. Vote and implementation

### 5. Delegate Your Vote

**Effort level:** Very Low
**Impact:** Indirect

If you can't vote actively, delegate to someone you trust.

#### How to Delegate

1. Go to [Realms](https://realms.today/dao/ORCA)
2. Find the delegation section
3. Enter the address of your delegate
4. Confirm the transaction

#### Choosing a Delegate

Look for someone who:
- Votes consistently
- Shares your values
- Communicates their positions
- Has a good track record

You can change or revoke delegation at any time.
