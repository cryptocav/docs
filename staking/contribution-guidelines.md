When using any Orca community platform you must comply with the rules laid out [here](https://discord.com/channels/798712664590254081/832364171450253312).
When commenting ensure you are discussing the proposal itself, you may suggest additions and amendments, but only to the current proposal. If your ideas are not compatible with the proposal, or are sufficiently different as to represent a separate idea, please create your own proposal.
When suggesting significant or lengthy additions or amendments, please format the post in a similar way to a standalone proposal: with an introduction, rationale/reasoning, and expected outcomes/benefits/advantages.
For the purpose of keeping discussions relevant and concise, please only comment when making new and unique contributions: react/like function can be used to show approval/disapproval.
The Orca Community is a global community, please remember that other Orca community members may not be native English users. If you do not have good English skills, consider reaching out to a relevant regional community manager for help.
