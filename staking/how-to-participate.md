#### Vote

The simplest way you can participate in the governance process is by voting on proposals.

Widespread participation in governance is both healthy for the protocol and empowers users. An individual user may not have enough voting power to swing a vote in their favored direction, but even a small number of votes may prove decisive.

Before voting you are encouraged to read the proposal, and related discussions, so that they are best able to make an informed decision.

#### Comment

Before a proposal reaches the voting stage it first goes through a period of consultation, if you feel confident you sufficiently understand a proposal you are actively encouraged to: discuss the proposal; seek clarifications; debate merits; or propose amendments or additions.

To avoid the discussion becoming difficult to follow, it is important you only post to the forum/Discord when making unique contributions: the react/like function should be used to indicate opinions, wherever possible, to ensure the discussion remains concise and easy to follow.

Guidelines on making comments and contributions can be found [here](/staking/governance-how-to/how-to-participate-in-governance/comments-and-contributions-guidelines).

#### Propose

When you have developed a deep understanding of Orca and DeFi, and have ideas that align with the Orca brand and mission, you are encouraged to bring these proposals forward for discussion. The council can make a proposal on your behalf, or in parallel, allowing meritorious ideas potential progression even when they arise from small ORCA token holders.

Proposals need not be complete when initially presented but should be sufficiently detailed, and professionally presented, to invite discussion from the community prior to the preparation of a full proposal.

When writing a proposal, you should seek to answer at least one of the following questions, and develop the idea in the order they are presented:

* What problem is the proposal addressing / what is the added value?
* What is being proposed / what is the change to be implemented?
* What are the costs of implementing this / what are the downsides?

Before formally introducing a proposal, discussion on an identified problem can be invited discussion by providing an answer for question #1, above, and other members of the community can help address #2 and #3.

As a proposal takes shape, it should answer other questions:

* How would the proposal be implemented?
* Who would be responsible for implementing it?
* Is it time critical / why should this be prioritized?
