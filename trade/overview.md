Orca is Solana's leading decentralized exchange, designed to make trading crypto simple, fast, and cost-effective. Whether you're swapping tokens for the first time or executing complex trades, Orca provides a seamless experience.

## Why Trade on Orca?

### Best Prices

## How Orca Works

### Concentrated Liquidity

Unlike traditional DEXs that spread liquidity across all possible prices, Orca uses Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs). This means:

| Traditional DEX | Orca CLMM |
|----------------|-----------|
| Liquidity spread thin | Liquidity concentrated around market price |
| Higher slippage | Lower slippage |
| Worse prices | Better prices |

When you make a trade, Orca:

1. Finds the best pool for your trade
2. Calculates the optimal route
3. Shows you the expected output
4. Executes with minimal slippage

## Trading Tips

### For Better Prices

- **Trade popular pairs** - More liquidity = better prices
- **Avoid small pools** - Low liquidity means higher slippage
- **Check the quote** - Compare Orca vs Jupiter pricing

### For Safer Trades

- **Set appropriate slippage** - Start with 0.5-1% for major pairs
- **Verify token addresses** - Especially for new or unfamiliar tokens
- **Start small** - Test with a small amount first

### Understanding Slippage

Slippage is the difference between expected and actual trade price. Higher volatility and lower liquidity increase slippage.
