### Why is my country or territory blocked?

* Designated as a high-risk or monitored jurisdiction by organizations like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

### What happens if my country or territory was previously unblocked, but is now blocked? Can I still withdraw or close my positions?

Yes, if your country or territory is now blocked, you may only close your positions and withdraw your funds.

### Why is Orca screening wallet addresses?

Orca screens wallet addresses to prevent individuals linked to illicit activities (such as sanctions evasion, terrorism financing, ransomware, human trafficking, or the use of hacked or stolen funds) from accessing the UI.

### Why was my wallet blocked?

Your wallet may have been blocked because it was flagged as potentially linked to illicit activity that violates Orca’s Terms of Use Policy.

### My wallet was blocked, but this is a mistake. How can I get unblocked?

If you believe your wallet was blocked by mistake, please contact our Compliance Team at [email protected](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#91f2fefce1fdf8f0fff2f4d1fee3f2f0bfe2fe) for information about the review and unblocking process.
